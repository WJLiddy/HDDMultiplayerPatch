# HDDMultiplayerPatch

This is a multiplayer patch for the 1999 strategy game Hidden and Dangerous: Deluxe. Hosting a server in Hidden and Dangerous: Deluxe sometimes does not work in Windows 7 and later versions. With the help of the game's creator, Michal Bacik, I created a patch to fix hosting a server in later versions of Windows.

## Installation

Step 1: Download and unzip this repository: https://github.com/WJLiddy/HDDMultiplayerPatch/archive/master.zip

Step 2: Delete the file "inet2.dll" from your Hidden and Dangerous Deluxe\bin folder. You can probably find it at C:\Program Files (x86)\Take2\Hidden and Dangerous Deluxe\bin. 

Step 3: From the folder you just downloaded, move the file "inet2.dll" into C:\Program Files (x86)\Take2\Hidden and Dangerous Deluxe\bin\

Step 4: Start the game, and play with your friends! (If you aren't all on the same network, I recommend using [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/) to set up an online game easily)
